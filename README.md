# DTMF Generator
This library provides methods for playing DTMF (ITU-T Recommendation Q.23), moderation tones (3GPP TS 22.001, CEPT), and proprietary (3GPP TS 31.111) tones. Depending on-call status and routing options, ringtones are mixed with downlink audio or output to speakerphone or headphones. This API is not for generating tones via the uplink audio path.
